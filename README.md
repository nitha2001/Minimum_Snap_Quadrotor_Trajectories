# Minimum_Snap_Quadrotor_Trajectories
This project focuses on formulating a minimum snap trajectory optimization problem for a planar quadrotor system. The goal is to generate efficient trajectories between given waypoints while minimizing snap, ensuring smooth transitions and compliance with dynamic constraints.
